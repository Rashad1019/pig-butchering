# Product Requirements Document: Pig Butchering Comprehensive Report

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will assemble a comprehensive static report from the extensive analysis already completed in the Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains complete financial flow analysis (4 Sankey diagrams), pattern analysis (6 visualizations), scale quantification (6 charts), and network analysis with all major data points already visualized. The goal is to organize these existing analyses into a cohesive narrative report that tells the complete story of pig butchering scam seriousness, suitable for both general public awareness and data professional analysis.

## Goals

1. **Educate and Raise Awareness**: Create public understanding of pig butchering scam severity and scope
2. **Demonstrate Scale**: Clearly communicate the $44B annual impact and projected $142B growth
3. **Show Human Cost**: Highlight the 313K forced workers and victim impact
4. **Expose System Vulnerabilities**: Illustrate banking weaknesses and enforcement gaps
5. **Tell Cohesive Story**: Present data as a narrative flow from problem to impact to urgency
6. **Professional Credibility**: Provide data-driven insights that meet professional analytical standards

## User Stories

**As a member of the general public**, I want to understand the true scale and seriousness of pig butchering scams so that I can be aware of the threat and protect myself and others.

**As a data professional/analyst**, I want to see comprehensive, well-visualized data about pig butchering operations so that I can understand the methodology, scale, and trends for my own analysis or reporting.

**As a policy maker or law enforcement official**, I want to see clear evidence of the problem's magnitude and systemic vulnerabilities so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and regulatory responses.

**As a journalist or researcher**, I want access to credible, well-documented visualizations that I can reference or adapt for public education and awareness campaigns.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Executive Summary Dashboard**: The report must create a comprehensive executive summary combining key findings from all existing analyses (pattern analysis, scale quantification, financial flows, network analysis)

2. **Existing Analysis Integration**: The system must incorporate all completed visualizations:
   - 4 Sankey diagrams (primary flow, regional, crypto conversion, temporal 48-hour)
   - 6 pattern analysis charts (temporal, banking vulnerabilities, geographic, lifecycle, enforcement)
   - 6 scale quantification charts (regional distribution, growth projections, banking involvement, trajectories, executive dashboard)
   - Network analysis visualizations (centrality analysis, enforcement priorities, risk assessment)

3. **Report Structure Assembly**: The report must organize existing content into logical sections:
   - Executive Summary (key statistics: $44B annual, 313K workers, 93% 48-hour conversion)
   - Scale and Growth Analysis (leveraging existing scale quantification charts)
   - Financial Flow Analysis (incorporating existing Sankey diagrams)
   - System Vulnerabilities (using existing pattern analysis and network analysis)
   - Enforcement and Future Outlook (combining trend analysis and projections)

4. **Professional Report Formatting**: The system must apply consistent formatting:
   - Unified color schemes across all visualizations
   - Professional headers, footers, and page layouts
   - Clear section dividers and navigation
   - Data source attribution and methodology notes

5. **Multi-Format Output**: The report must be generated in:
   - PDF format for official distribution
   - High-resolution PNG sections for presentations
   - Structured layout suitable for both digital and print use

6. **Narrative Flow**: The report must present a cohesive story using existing analyses, flowing from problem identification → scale demonstration → system analysis → enforcement implications

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Interactive Features**: No interactive dashboards, drill-down capabilities, or dynamic filtering
2. **Real-time Data**: No live data feeds or automatic updates
3. **Predictive Modeling**: No new analytical models beyond existing projections
4. **Individual Case Studies**: No specific victim stories or detailed criminal profiles
5. **Technical Implementation Details**: No code explanations or methodology deep-dives
6. **Multi-language Support**: English-only initial version
7. **Custom Data Input**: No ability for users to input their own data

## Design Considerations

1. **Accessibility**: Use colorblind-friendly palettes and high contrast ratios
2. **Professional Aesthetic**: Clean, modern design suitable for official presentations
3. **Scalable Graphics**: Vector-based visualizations that work in print and digital formats
4. **Consistent Branding**: Unified color scheme and typography throughout
5. **Mobile Consideration**: Ensure readability on various screen sizes
6. **Print-Friendly**: Optimize for both screen viewing and printing

## Technical Considerations

1. **Data Sources**: Leverage all existing analysis files:
   - comprehensive_pattern_analysis_summary.json (temporal patterns, banking vulnerabilities, enforcement analysis)
   - comprehensive_scale_quantification_summary.json (growth projections, regional distribution, banking involvement)
   - comprehensive_sankey_analysis.json (financial flow analysis)
   - money_laundering_comprehensive_data.json (complete data structure)
   - All existing PNG visualizations (pattern analysis, scale quantification, network analysis)
   - All existing HTML Sankey diagrams

2. **Notebook Integration**: Work within existing notebook_erRCZ.ipynb structure with established:
   - Visualization libraries (matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, networkx)
   - Data processing functions and configurations
   - Professional styling and color schemes

3. **Output Generation**: Create report assembly functions for:
   - PDF compilation using existing visualizations
   - High-resolution image extraction and formatting
   - Professional layout and typography

4. **File Organization**: Maintain existing directory structure and add report outputs alongside current files

## Success Metrics

1. **Comprehensive Integration**: All existing analyses (16+ visualizations) are successfully incorporated into cohesive report
2. **Narrative Coherence**: Report tells complete story from scale → flows → vulnerabilities → enforcement using existing data
3. **Professional Presentation**: Publication-ready formatting suitable for official distribution
4. **Accessibility**: Clear executive summary allows non-technical users to grasp key findings quickly
5. **Data Fidelity**: All existing analysis findings are accurately represented and properly attributed
6. **Multi-Format Usability**: Report works effectively in both PDF and presentation formats

## Open Questions

1. Should the report include a methodology appendix explaining data sources and calculations?
2. What specific call-to-action or next steps should be included for different audiences?
3. Should there be multiple versions optimized for different distribution channels (social media, official reports, academic papers)?
4. What level of detail should be included about specific criminal organizations vs. aggregate patterns?
5. Should the report include comparison data with other types of financial crimes for context?
